# CAT Inspect - Voice Enabled Inspection Application

**CAT Inspect** is an AI-powered application designed to revolutionize equipment inspections for service technicians. Developed during the Caterpillar hackathon at VIT, this prototype offers a cutting-edge solution to streamline inspections with minimal manual input.

## Key Features

- **Voice-Guided Inspection:** Perform inspections using voice commands, eliminating the need for manual typing.
- **Prompted Data Entry:** Automatically prompts technicians to capture specific details based on the inspection form.
- **Voice Recording:** Record findings for each section and navigate through prompts using predefined voice commands (e.g., "OK").
- **Image Capture:** Capture images of equipment parts through voice commands.
- **Parameter Recording:** Record parameter values and identify specific issues (e.g., "Broken," "High," "Low").
- **Inspection Validation:** Review, validate, and enhance the inspection report before finalization.
- **Report Storage and Retrieval:** Store and retrieve inspection reports with search capability based on report identifiers.
- **Summary Generation:** Generate summary reports with actions needed and export details to PDF, including images.
- **Multilingual Support:** Voice-based inspection available in multiple languages (e.g., Hindi, English).

## Outcome

Our prototype secured 5th place at the Caterpillar hackathon, demonstrating our solution's capability to enhance inspection efficiency and accuracy through advanced AI and voice recognition technologies.
